Description: # pycle
        Pycle, stands for PYthon Compressive LEarning. It is a toolbox of methods to perform compressive learning (also known as sketched learning), where the training set is not used directly but first heavily compressed; this allows to learn from large-scale datasets with drastically reduced computational resources.
        *Pycle is currently under development* (version `0.9`), so please come back soon or use it at your own risks.
        
        ## Planned features
        This is a rough plan of the next features to be implemented.
        
        ### Short-term
        * The heurisitic to select $\sigma$ from a (sub-)sketch of the dataset
        * A function to update the sketch (e.g. for data streams)
        
        ### Mid-term
        * Write the guide for the toolbox
        * Some starting examples
        * Better support for parallel computing
        * Compressive Classification integration
        
        ### Long-term
        * Implement fast transforms
        * Implement an alternative clustering algorithm from the sketch based on https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02311624/document
        * GMM estimation with nondiagonal covariance matrices
